# Julia Cyphering

A collection of cryptographic algorithms implemented in the Julia programming language. This repository includes efficient and easy to understand implementations of classic ciphers, designed for educational purposes and cryptographic exploration.

## Usage

Each script is standalone and can be run in a Julia environment. Ensure you have Julia installed, then execute the scripts using:

```sh
julia <script_name>.jl
```

> Modify the scripts to experiment with different keys, alphabets, or input texts.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a learning resource for those interested in cryptography and Julia programming. It demonstrates how to implement fundamental ciphers while leveraging Julia's performance and simplicity.
